LaunchDarkly is a SaaS platform for developers to manage feature flags. By decoupling feature rollout and code deployment, LaunchDarkly enables developers to test their code live in production, gradually release features to groups of users, and manage flags throughout their entire lifecycle.

Your dedicated LaunchDarkly environment is available at https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/projects/default/environments/ramiro/features
